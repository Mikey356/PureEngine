🛠️ Custom FPS Game Engine

This engine is designed and developed by me with the specific goal of powering a custom first-person shooter (FPS) game. It’s a personal project that I’m building from the ground up to deepen my understanding of game engine development and rendering systems.

The engine is tailored to fit the unique needs of my game, and I'll be updating it regularly as development progresses. While it's not intended to be a professional-grade engine, it aims to be a clean, understandable, and flexible codebase for educational and experimental purposes.

Feel free to explore, learn from, or even use the source code in your own projects!
🚧 Work in Progress

 Please note: This engine is still in early development and is not yet production-ready.

Planned features include:

    🔲 Custom rendering pipeline using OpenGL (or other API, depending on progress)

    🔲 Entity-component system (ECS)

    🔲 Input handling (keyboard & mouse)

    🔲 Basic physics and collision detection

    🔲 Level loading system

    🔲 Debug UI

    🔲 Scripting support (possible Python/C++ hybrid)

    🔲 Audio support

    🔲 Multiplayer prototype (stretch goal)

🎯 Project Goals

    Build a lightweight, understandable FPS engine from scratch.

    Integrate all engine systems into a custom FPS game.

    Learn and document low-level systems like rendering, memory management, and input.

    Maintain clean, readable code and meaningful architecture decisions.

🔓 License & Usage

This engine is open-source and free to use. You can:

    Use the code in your own projects

    Modify or expand upon it

    Study it for educational purposes

Just please give credit where appropriate if you use significant parts of the engine in your own work.
🙏 Disclaimer

This is not a professional or commercial game engine. It’s an evolving learning project and may include bugs, missing features, or architectural changes as I learn more and improve it.
